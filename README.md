Assignment : Individual Assignment (60%)
Module : CT073-3-2 Computer System Low Level Techniques
Date Assigned : Week 1 - 5th August 2024
Date Due : Week 12 – 20th October 2024
Learning Outcome of the Assignment (CLO2 and CLO3)
1. Propose a working programme using machine-level language with any appropriate
assembly programming tools (A3, PLO6)
2. Present error-free assembly programme with its constructs based on a given scenario
(A2, PLO5)
Instructions:
1. No marks will be awarded for the entire assignment if any part of it is found to be
copied directly from online materials or from another student.
2. All submissions should be made online on or before the due date.
3. Any late submissions after the deadline will not be entertained.
4. Zero (0) mark will be awarded for late submission, unless extenuating circumstances
are upheld.
TASK
Design and develop a basic system using assembly language for the x86 architecture. You
can choose to implement a Library Management System, Point of Sales System, or any other
system of your preference. The system must utilize arithmetic calculations, loops, and jumps
as fundamental operations.
Requirements:
1. System Design: Clearly define the functionalities of your system and prepare the
system flow diagram using flowchart.
2. Implementation: Write the assembly language code to implement the system using
assemblers either TASM, MASM or NASM
3. Features:
o Include arithmetic operations.
o Use loops for iterative processes.
o Employ jumps for conditional and unconditional branching.

4. You are expected to demonstrate creativity in developing an application using
assembly language prototype that can deal with the requirements as stated above.
You may address (if necessary) any other aspects of control of the application.
5. You have to work on the prototype individually.
6. You are permitted to make assumptions where necessary. These assumptions are
expected to be logical and must be appropriate for the situation at hand.
7. There will be a presentation towards the submission date of the project. You are
expected to demonstrate how your system can address the requirements as stated
above.
8. The submission of your project should entail the following items:
a. Research and Analysis (choose i or ii) :
i. Assembly language is still necessary in many disciplines because it
interacts directly with hardware and uses resources efficiently.
Research and discuss the area where assembly language is still in use.
ii. Research on how the low-level language is being used in
cybersecurity and forensic fields. Your research may include malware
analysis and reverse engineering.
b. Softcopy user manual or guide that can explain how your system works. This
will be based on your system application.
c. System submission (source code)
9. Your completed documentation should meet the following requirements:
• Table of contents for every detailed section
• Introduction on Assembly Language
• Research and Analysis (8ai OR 8aii)
• System Design using flowchart.
• System Screenshot
• Source Code with explanation
• Conclusion
• References
• Appendices if necessary
